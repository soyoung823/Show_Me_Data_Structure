1. Problem explanations

2. Complexity explanations
Time Complexity: 
Building PriorityList: O(n^2)
Building Huffman Tree: O(n^2)
Huffman_codes dictionary building: O(n)
Encoding with dictionary: O(n)
Decoding: Assume that the number of unique characters is m, the tree depth will be O(log m). Thus, total time complexity is O(n log m).
